# Code_AD_simulations

In this Repo you can find a code for simulating brain signals from a mean-field model of the cortex.
The model is set to simulate activity in various stages of Alzheimer disease. 
There are some rudimentary analytic tools to investigate functional connectivity and power spectra distribution of simulated signals.
There is also the possibility to implement a visuo-attentive task by means of a virtual stimulation (preliminary)

The code is implemented in Python and only requires commercially available packages, along with The Virtual Brain Software. This is 
also written in Python, and available at "https://thevirtualbrain.org/tvb/zwei"
